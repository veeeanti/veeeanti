## yo waddup

Beginner coder, programmer, and whatever else applies to me and what all that I do, which is what ever interests me lol.
Android stuff, Windows stuff, game related things, reverse engineering / cracking (not that good enough yet really).
I work with Union-Crax as part of their team, [visit the site](https://union-crax.xyz/) and join our Discord server too! Everyone is welcome, and also to make requests for games to be listed too.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on...
  - UC custom steam emulator (one day...)
  - Half-Life: Opposing Force PS2 Port
  - My [website & its features](https://vee-anti.xyz/)

- 💬 Ask me about...
  - Whatever you wanna know, I'll do my best to answer I'm asked about.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with...
  - That PS2 port of HL: OpFor. Haven't had much time to do it but now I'm looking to get back into it, I need help with decompiling / or just modifying whatever contains the dll for HL and replace it with OpFor's, editing textures / pictures, correctly converting models and sprites, basically the whole thing. ([I've gotten somewhat far in the past this year, though with endless issues and mistakes and softlocks that would be found on PC too if loaded incorrectly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1i0u21d/welp_it_went_from_bad_to_worse_opfor_ps2_port/))
  - Another Half-Life project: Implementing Xperia Play touchpad support in the Android port of Xash3D FWGS [Old Engine] and fix the keypad inputs to properly read the Play's gamepad inputs and get the touchpad working for better experiences overall. (Touchpad uses C & Java code to work, I have absolutely no idea how to make that work and Sony Ericcson's documentation on it is abysmal from what I was able to make sense of. I just need to have it explained better so I can actually understand and figure out how exactly to do it. NOT looking for others to do it for me, I asked for help one time in a server that had channels for support with stuff like coding, hardware, general tech support, and was practically chastised for it even though I stated I was doing the work myself and only needed help UNDERSTANDING the C & Java code, especially for Android 2.3! Rant over, just still infuriated over that.)

  - Just message me on here, or whatever the equivalent to that is for this, lol.

- 😄 Pronouns:
  - She / they.
  - I'm trans-female, by the way. (I don't care if you don't care about that, I'd rather not have any confusions about what I am.)

- ⚡ Fun(?) fact about me, and whatever else comes to mind:
  - I'm 22. (very very old, I know.)
  - I love music, I listen to anything - if it sounds good / scratches my brain the right way, I like it and will listen to it.
     - My favorite artists are Buckethead (in all forms - himself, w/ Praxis, C.C.B.o.B.B, and Guns N' Roses [the Chinese Democracy] album), ZUN / Team Shanghai Alice, MonochroMenace, INABAKUMORI, Rihanna, Femtanyl, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Wu-Tang Clan, Steely Dan, and many others. I also really love listening to game OSTs too, I'll refrain from going on for any longer with this and not list them, ahah... (It'd go on for way longer, I think..?)
  - I like anime, but I haven't been able to watch much of any in a long while. The last thing I REALLY got into and still am really into is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I also enjoyed Dragon Ball Z Kai, Bleach, Death Note, Outlaw Star, Cowboy Bebop, PoyoPoyo, .hack//SIGN and .hack//LIMINALITY as well.
  - It's illegal to walk down the street with an ice cream cone in your back pocket in Alabama, if I remember correctly. (who did that so many times that they outlawed it, and WHY???)
  - My current username is a combination of my old username "Antitheus" and "Ivy", a name that my ex gave me a while back. I wemt by Vee more often though, but it came from that name they came up with for me. People couldn't pronounce Antitheus correctly, and I got bored of the edgy latin name and felt Ivy / Vee was more fitting, but still wanted to keep that particular name as the surname, but combining them for my display name online, "veeanti". On Discord, I have a lowercase lambda in place of the a to show my love for the Half-Life series. It looks like this, "veeλnti". Also, I really like how it reads and looks, I was hoping it was an original name but after googling it I was depressed to find I wasn't, but at least there's only one other person who came up with that name. (It's the Facebook page, "Veeanti Blue. I have nothing to do with that in any way whatsoever.)

Have a nice day / night / time! Thank you for reading this wall of nonsense if you actually read through all of it, I apologize for any brain cell loss it may have caused you in advance lmao. ^^
